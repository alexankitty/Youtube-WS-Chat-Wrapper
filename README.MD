# Youtube-WS-Chat-Wrapper
This project is designed to be used with my other project Holo-Chat. Due to google thinking 43 seconds is enough time to query the API for live chat messages, currently this is the ideal way to implement this without making the CORS gods angry.  
This software is fairly untested, use at your own risk.

## Basic Directions
* Run the following commands to install the necessary dependencies.
```shell
npm i youtube-chat
npm i ws
```  
or substitute accordingly with yarn.

* Start the program with `node app.js`
* Test it out with the included ytchat.html. Set the id to either the channel id you wish to observer or the live stream id. The server will attempt to figure it out.
